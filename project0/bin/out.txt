Hadas Calderon, whose two children and ex-husband were taken by Hamas on 7 October, is pleading with Israeli authorities to make the safe return of hostages their top priority.
"Our children's lives are in their hands. I am asking them not to forget our children. They must make a ceasefire and [agree to a] prisoner exchange," she told BBC Newshour from Tel Aviv.
Calderon was among hundreds of people who gathered in Tel Aviv on Saturday to demand the release of their relatives who have been taken hostage.
Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that his military's top priority is to "completely eliminate" the Hamas group although he said speaking to the families of the hostages broke his heart.
Calderon also appealed to Hamas.
"I am begging them, take care of our children and make sure they are safe... They are innocent. This is not their war."
Her son had turned 12 after his abduction and Calderon said the family held a "surrealistic" birthday party without him.
"We [bought] a big bike because he loves to mountain bike... That's still waiting for him to come and pick it. I want him and I want my girl, my sweet girl, and their father also - I want them back. And immediately."
